The source code to my personal website and its blog posts.

It is a statically served website that uses client-side JavaScript for dynamic content retrieval like the blog and GitHub feeds. Some may call this "serverless", however I don't think that makes sense as the content is still being served from a server - just not my own.

The source code is public for educational purposes, however I reserve all rights to any media **not** listed under an explicit license/copyright ownership in its directory.
